"    <h2>Overview</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Hello! At Silent Selene, you can upload your Touhou replays, as well "
"as take a look at other replays that interest you. We need to collect and "
"store some information in order to make this happen; here we describe how "
"that happens.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>What this document covers</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        This Privacy Policy covers silentselene.net, the website.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>\n"
"    <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Most of the information we collect is information that is provided "
"to us by you. For example:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Basic account information:</b> We collect certain "
"information, such as a username, password and email address, so that you can "
"have and log into an account. Of course, we store any settings or "
"preferences you set on your account, too, such as language preference or "
"what games you're interested in.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Public profile information:</b> Some information, such as "
"your username, is present on your public profile, and is considered public "
"information. Note that your email address is not public information.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Content:</b> Silent Selene is primarily a site to share "
"replays. As such, we will store replays and information about them, so that "
"you or other people can check them out later.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We also collect some information automatically.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Log information:</b> Like most online service providers, "
"we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers "
"typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique "
"device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time "
"of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\n"
"            </li>\n"

"\n"
"    <h2>How and Why We Use Information</h2>\n"
"    <h3>How We Use Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We use information about you for the purposes below:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To make our site function.</b> For example, to set up and "
"maintain your account, make your replays available, and provide additional "
"fun information about your experiences with Touhou.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To make our site better.</b> For example, by seeing how "
"users interact with our Services to see what features are popular.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To protect Silent Selene, our users, and the public.</b> "
"For example, by detecting security incidents, or detecting malicious, "
"deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity on the site. In the past, "
"malicious actors have used Touhou fansites harm other people, such as by "
"publicizing personal information about innocent figures, or impersonating "
"other players to destroy their reputation; we wish to prevent Silent Selene "
"from becoming a venue for these attacks, or from being attacked itself.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To fix problems with Silent Selene.</b> For example, by "
"detecting or fixing bugs on our website.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To communicate with you.</b> For example, to share "
"information about your content with you.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>EU note: What's our legal basis?</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Our processing of personal data is based on two bases. Most of our "
"processing occurs after the user has consented; for example, a person may "
"create an account, and then we use their username, password and email "
"address to let them use the account later. Or, a user may upload content to "
"be seen by others, and then we show that content to others. Some information "
"is processed to protect our legitimate interests, such as our interest in "
"not allowing Silent Selene to be used as a venue for attacks on other "
"people; for example, we collect and store IP addresses in order to make it "
"more difficult for a banned user to access the site in the future.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Sharing Information</h2>\n"
"    <h3>How We Share Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We share information about you in only limited circumstances.\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Third-party services:</b> We use third-party services in "
"order to provide our Services. For example, the server for our website is "
"provided by Vultr, and e-mails are sent out using the Amazon Simple Email "
"Service. We only use third-party services in a manner consistent with this "
"Privacy Policy.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Legal and regulatory requirements:</b> We may disclose "
"information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other "
"governmental request. This seems like a rather unlikely scenario, but it is "
"listed here for completeness. Please do not commit crimes in your Touhou "
"replays. Capturing Sakuya's final spell, \"Eternal Meek\", by using a "
"safespot is not considered a crime for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "
"though it may lead to bad karma or punishment in the afterlife.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Public Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Public information is, in fact, public. If you choose to make "
"information public, we will disclose it publicly. Visitors on the website "
"may see it, and we may provide it to third-party services such as Discord if "
"other people share links to it there. In addition, we may make the public "
"replays posted on our site available in bulk to other people.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We only keep information for as long as it is necessary for the "
"purposes for which we collect and use it. For some information, this means "
"we keep it indefinitely unless you request it be removed; for example, if "
"you upload a replay, we will keep it until you delete it.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        If a user has requested that information be deleted, we may retain "
"that information for a short period of time, in order to preserve backups, "
"investigate problems with the site, let the user change their mind, or other "
"necessary purposes. However, in almost all cases, we will not preserve such "
"information for over 120 days. All exceptions to this 120-day rule are "
"explicitly listed below.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We record the IP addresses of visitors to the site. If the visitor "
"is logged in with their account, we associate it with the account in "
"question. This is necessary to protect the website from people who would "
"misuse it. As above, these IP addresses are not stored for over 120 days.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We may ban IP addresses from accessing the site, if necessary to "
"protect it. In this case, we will continue to store the IP address in "
"question, as well as why it was banned. This information will not be kept "
"for over 15 years.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        If an account is suspended, we will keep its username, email "
"address, and the reason for the suspension in our records for the duration "
"of the suspension, even if the user in question requests their account be "
"deleted. This is necessary to prevent them from evading their ban, and thus "
"to protect the site as a whole. This information will not be kept for longer "
"than 120 days after either the suspension expires or after the account's "
"deletion is requested, whichever is later. Suspensions will always expire at "
"most 15 years after they are instituted.\n"
"    </p>\n"

"    <h2>\n"
"        Security\n"
"    </h2>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        No service is completely secure, but we work hard to protect the "
"information about you from unauthorized access or use.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h2>\n"
"        Choices\n"
"    </h2>\n"
"\n"
"    If you do not want us using your information, the best solution is to "
"refrain from providing it to us. Most notably, if you don't wish to give us "
"an email address or online identifier, don't create an account. If you "
"create an account and later regret it, you can request we delete your "
"existing account.\n"

"    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n"
"    <p>These rules are preliminary; we will adjust them based on feedback "
"from the community. If we do, we might have to recategorize some replays.</"
"p>\n"
"    <h2>Overview</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        There are three types of replays on Silent Selene: regular, TAS, and "
"unlisted. Most replays are <b>regular</b>; that describes runs that are "
"played normally, without any unusual tools to assist the player. (Tools that "
"do not change the character of the run are still allowed in regular "
"replays.) <b>TAS</b> replays are tool-assisted; any helper tools are "
"allowed, even ones that are obviously \"cheating\" like save states. But the "
"replay still has to be a replay of the actual game. And <b>unlisted</b> runs "
"are everything else; this category mostly applies to replays that changed "
"the game's patterns somehow or made other crazy changes.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>tl;dr</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        For regular runs, most tools like vpatch are allowed. Translation "
"patches are allowed. Pause buffering is not allowed.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Is My Replay Regular?</h2>\n"
"    <h3>General Rules</h3>\n"
"    <h4>Expert replays</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        A few things are not allowed in <b>expert replays</b>, but are "
"allowed for everyone else. Some things shouldn't be allowed at high levels "
"of competition, but we don't want to restrict novice and intermediate "
"players too much, especially if they're excited to upload replays of their "
"successful runs. An expert replay is any replay which meets any of these "
"criteria:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Lunatic\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Uses no bombs\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Does not miss; that is, does not lose a life\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Has a good score: a score noticeably higher than that of an "
"average 1cc that does not engage with the scoring mechanics\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <h4>What's Allowed</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        These tools (and classes of tools) are OK to use in regular "
"replays.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            The low-latency tool \"vpatch\" is allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Special DLLs to translate DirectX to other graphics APIs are "
"allowed. For example, \"ENB Converter\" and \"dgVoodoo\" are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Emulators, or other tools that run a binary on an operating "
"system or computer for which it was not designed, are allowed. This includes "
"PC-98 emulators such as \"Neko Project II\", as well as programs like "
"\"Wine\" that allow players to run Windows games on other operating "
"systems.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Patches which translate the game's text are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Patches which modify the way the game's score is displayed so as "
"to avoid a \"counterstop\" are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <h4>What's Banned</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The following things are explicitly not allowed in regular replays.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Any patch that modifies the game's behavior is not allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Loading save states is not allowed. This includes any "
"\"runahead\" emulator functionality that relies on save states.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Pause buffering, the technique of repeatedly pausing in quick "
"succession to gain an advantage, is not allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Pausing to gain an advantage, such as pausing when bullets are "
"onscreen in order to read them, is not allowed. We may exempt specific "
"replays from this rule if we deem the advantage unintentional.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Editing a replay file after it has been saved is not allowed "
"(except for renaming it).\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <h4>My tool isn't mentioned!</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        If a type of tool isn't listed above, feel free to ask the Silent "
"Selene staff to clarify the situation; we will judge these tools on a case-"
"by-case basis and update the rules accordingly.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h3>Game-specific rules</h3>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            <b>TH06</b>: Texture patches that affect the appearance of the "
"game, such as the \"hitbox patch\", are not allowed in expert replays.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            <b>TH10</b>: \"Hint files\" are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            <b>TH11</b>: \"Hint files\" are not allowed.\n"

"allowed by applicable law, including, without limitation, the warranties of "

"\n"
"    <h3>Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the "
"Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the "
"laws of the state of New York, U.S.A. Nothing in this Agreement affects your "

"\n"
"    <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"

"        European Users: If we cause damage to you and you are in Europe, we "
"limit our liability to the maximum amount permissible in your country of "

"breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of "
"contract. Silent Selene isn't liable for damages that result from a non-"
"material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of "
"liability will not apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, "
"to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, "
"liability caused by our willful misconduct or gross negligence, or our "
"responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you. To the "
"extent that our liability is limited or excluded, the limitations or "
"exclusions will also apply to the personal liability of our legal "
"representatives and vicarious agents.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Indemnification</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Silent Selene, its "
"contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, "
"employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, "
"demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, "
"arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not "
"limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider "
"of third-party services used in connection with the Services or Content that "
"you post.\n"

"    <p>\n"

"translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict "
"between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the "
"English version will control.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply "
"to any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between Silent "
"Selene and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is "
"unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement, "

"Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the "
"Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such "
