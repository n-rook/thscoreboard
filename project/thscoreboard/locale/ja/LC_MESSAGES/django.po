"    <h2>Overview</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Hello! At Silent Selene, you can upload your Touhou replays, as well as take a look at other replays that interest you. We need to collect and store some information in order to make this happen; here we describe how that happens.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>What this document covers</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        This Privacy Policy covers silentselene.net, the website.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>\n"
"    <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Most of the information we collect is information that is provided to us by you. For example:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Basic account information:</b> We collect certain information, such as a username, password and email address, so that you can have and log into an account. Of course, we store any settings or preferences you set on your account, too, such as language preference or what games you're interested in.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Public profile information:</b> Some information, such as your username, is present on your public profile, and is considered public information. Note that your email address is not public information.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Content:</b> Silent Selene is primarily a site to share replays. As such, we will store replays and information about them, so that you or other people can check them out later.\n"

"        </ul>\n"

"    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>\n"

"        We also collect some information automatically.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Log information:</b> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\n"

"    <h2>How and Why We Use Information</h2>\n"
"    <h3>How We Use Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We use information about you for the purposes below:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To make our site function.</b> For example, to set up and maintain your account, make your replays available, and provide additional fun information about your experiences with Touhou.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To make our site better.</b> For example, by seeing how users interact with our Services to see what features are popular.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To protect Silent Selene, our users, and the public.</b> For example, by detecting security incidents, or detecting malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity on the site. In the past, malicious actors have used Touhou fansites harm other people, such as by publicizing personal information about innocent figures, or impersonating other players to destroy their reputation; we wish to prevent Silent Selene from becoming a venue for these attacks, or from being attacked itself.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To fix problems with Silent Selene.</b> For example, by detecting or fixing bugs on our website.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To communicate with you.</b> For example, to share information about your content with you.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>EU note: What's our legal basis?</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Our processing of personal data is based on two bases. Most of our processing occurs after the user has consented; for example, a person may create an account, and then we use their username, password and email address to let them use the account later. Or, a user may upload content to be seen by others, and then we show that content to others. Some information is processed to protect our legitimate interests, such as our interest in not allowing Silent Selene to be used as a venue for attacks on other people; for example, we collect and store IP addresses in order to make it more difficult for a banned user to access the site in the future.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Sharing Information</h2>\n"
"    <h3>How We Share Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We share information about you in only limited circumstances.\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Third-party services:</b> We use third-party services in order to provide our Services. For example, the server for our website is provided by Vultr, and e-mails are sent out using the Amazon Simple Email Service. We only use third-party services in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Legal and regulatory requirements:</b> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. This seems like a rather unlikely scenario, but it is listed here for completeness. Please do not commit crimes in your Touhou replays. Capturing Sakuya's final spell, \"Eternal Meek\", by using a safespot is not considered a crime for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, though it may lead to bad karma or punishment in the afterlife.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Public Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Public information is, in fact, public. If you choose to make information public, we will disclose it publicly. Visitors on the website may see it, and we may provide it to third-party services such as Discord if other people share links to it there. In addition, we may make the public replays posted on our site available in bulk to other people.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We only keep information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which we collect and use it. For some information, this means we keep it indefinitely unless you request it be removed; for example, if you upload a replay, we will keep it until you delete it.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        If a user has requested that information be deleted, we may retain that information for a short period of time, in order to preserve backups, investigate problems with the site, let the user change their mind, or other necessary purposes. However, in almost all cases, we will not preserve such information for over 120 days. All exceptions to this 120-day rule are explicitly listed below.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We record the IP addresses of visitors to the site. If the visitor is logged in with their account, we associate it with the account in question. This is necessary to protect the website from people who would misuse it. As above, these IP addresses are not stored for over 120 days.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We may ban IP addresses from accessing the site, if necessary to protect it. In this case, we will continue to store the IP address in question, as well as why it was banned. This information will not be kept for over 15 years.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        If an account is suspended, we will keep its username, email address, and the reason for the suspension in our records for the duration of the suspension, even if the user in question requests their account be deleted. This is necessary to prevent them from evading their ban, and thus to protect the site as a whole. This information will not be kept for longer than 120 days after either the suspension expires or after the account's deletion is requested, whichever is later. Suspensions will always expire at most 15 years after they are instituted.\n"

"    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n"
"    <p>These rules are preliminary; we will adjust them based on feedback from the community. If we do, we might have to recategorize some replays.</p>\n"
"    <h2>Overview</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        There are three types of replays on Silent Selene: standard, tool-assisted, and unusual. Most replays are <b>standard</b>; that describes runs that are played normally, without any unusual tools to assist the player. (Tools that do not change the character of the run are still allowed in standard replays.) <b>Tool-assisted</b> replays are runs played with help from external software; any helper tools are allowed, even ones that are obviously \"cheating\" like save states. But the replay still has to be a replay of the actual game. And <b>unusual</b> runs are everything else; this category mostly applies to replays that changed the game's patterns somehow or made other crazy changes.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>tl;dr</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        For standard runs, most tools like vpatch are allowed. Translation patches are allowed. Pause buffering is not allowed.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Is My Replay Standard?</h2>\n"
"    <h3>General Rules</h3>\n"
"    <h4>Expert replays</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        A few things are not allowed in <b>expert replays</b>, but are allowed for everyone else. Some things shouldn't be allowed at high levels of competition, but we don't want to restrict novice and intermediate players too much, especially if they're excited to upload replays of their successful runs. An expert replay is any replay which meets any of these criteria:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Lunatic\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Uses no bombs\n"

"            Does not miss; that is, does not lose a life\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Has a good score: a score noticeably higher than that of an average 1cc that does not engage with the scoring mechanics\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <h4>What's Allowed</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        These tools (and classes of tools) are OK to use in standard replays.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            The low-latency tool \"vpatch\" is allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Special DLLs to translate DirectX to other graphics APIs are allowed. For example, \"ENB Converter\" and \"dgVoodoo\" are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Emulators, or other tools that run a binary on an operating system or computer for which it was not designed, are allowed. This includes PC-98 emulators such as \"Neko Project II\", as well as programs like \"Wine\" that allow players to run Windows games on other operating systems.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Patches which translate the game's text are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Patches which modify the way the game's score is displayed so as to avoid a \"counterstop\" are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <h4>What's Banned</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The following things are explicitly not allowed in standard replays.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Any patch that modifies the game's behavior is not allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Loading save states is not allowed. This includes any \"runahead\" emulator functionality that relies on save states.\n"

"<h2>概要 </h2>\n"
"<p>\n"
"Silent Seleneのリプレイには、スタンダード、ツールアシスト、特殊の3種類があります。ほとんどのリプレイは<b>標準的</b>なもので、プレイヤーを補助する特別な道具を使わず、普通にプレイすることを指します。(プレイの性質を変えないツールは、標準的なリプレイでも使用可能です)。<b>ツールアシストリプレイ</b>は、外部ソフトウェアの助けを借りてプレイするもので、セーブステート(無限リトライ)のような明らかに「不正」と思われるものであっても、どんな補助ツールでも許可されます。しかし、リプレイは実際のゲームのリプレイでなければならない。<b>特殊プレイ</b>は主に、ゲームのパターンを何らかの方法で変更したり、その他のおかしな変更を加えたリプレイに適用されます。 \n"

"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between Silent Selene and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Silent Selene may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with our prior written consent.\n"
