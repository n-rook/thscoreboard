"    <h2>Overview</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Hello! At Silent Selene, you can upload your Touhou replays, as well "
"as take a look at other replays that interest you. We need to collect and "
"store some information in order to make this happen; here we describe how "
"that happens.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>What this document covers</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        This Privacy Policy covers silentselene.net, the website.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>\n"
"    <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Most of the information we collect is information that is provided "
"to us by you. For example:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Basic account information:</b> We collect certain "
"information, such as a username and password, so that you can have and log "
"into an account. Of course, we store any settings or preferences you set on "
"your account, too, such as language preference or what games you're "
"interested in.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Public profile information:</b> Some information, such as "
"your username, is present on your public profile, and is considered public "
"information. Note that your email address is not public information.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Content:</b> Silent Selene is primarily a site to share "
"replays. As such, we will store replays and information about them, so that "
"you or other people can check them out later.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We also collect some information automatically.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Log information:</b> Like most online service provides, "
"we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers "
"typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique "
"device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time "
"of access, operation system, and mobile network information.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Location information:</b> We may use your IP address or "
"other identifiers to guess your location, in order to provide features such "
"as automatic language detection.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are a foundational technology of the "

"\n"
"    <h2>How and Why We Use Information</h2>\n"
"    <h3>How We Use Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We use information about you for the purposes below:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To provide our Services.</b> For example, to set up and "
"maintain your account, make your replays available, and provide additional "
"fun information about your experiences with Touhou.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To improve our Services.</b> For example, by seeing how "
"users interact with our Services to see what features are popular.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</b> "
"For example, by detecting security incidents, or detecting malicious, "
"deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity on the site. In the past, "
"malicious actors have used Touhou fansites harm other people, such as by "
"publicizing personal information about innocent figures, or impersonating "
"other players to destroy their reputation; we wish to prevent Silent Selene "
"from becoming a venue for these attacks, or from being attacked itself.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To fix problems with our Services.</b> For example, by "
"detecting or fixing bugs on our website.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>To communicate with you.</b> For example, to share "
"information about your content with you.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>EU note: What's our legal basis?</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Our processing of personal data is based on two bases. Most of our "
"processing occurs after the user has consented; for example, a person may "
"create an account, and then we use their username and password to let them "
"use the account later. Or, a user may upload Content to be seen by others, "
"and then we show that Content to others. Some information is processed to "
"protect our legitimate interests, such as our interest in not allowing "
"Silent Selene to be used as a venue for attacks on other people; for "
"example, we collect and store IP addresses in order to make it more "
"difficult for a banned user to access the site in the future.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Sharing Information</h2>\n"
"    <h3>How We Share Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We share information about you in only limited circumstances.\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Third-party services:</b> We use third-party services in "
"order to provide our Services. For example, our website is hosted by another "
"company. We only use third-party services in a manner consistent with this "
"Privacy Policy.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"            <li>\n"
"                <b>Legal and regulatory requirements:</b> We may disclose "
"information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other "
"governmental request. This seems like a rather unlikely scenario, but it is "
"listed here for completeness. Please do not commit crimes in your Touhou "
"replays. Capturing Sakuya's final spell, \"Eternal Meek\", by using a "
"safespot is not considered a crime for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, "
"though it may lead to bad karma or punishment in the afterlife.\n"
"            </li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Public Information</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Public information is, in fact, public. If you choose to make "
"information public, we will disclose it publicly. Visitors on the website "
"may see it, and we may provide it to third-party services such as Discord if "
"other people share links to it there. In addition, we may make the public "
"replays posted on our site available in bulk to other people.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We generally discard information about you when it's no longer "
"needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it. For example, if "
"content is deleted, we stop storing it in our database within 30 days after "
"its deletion. After this time period is up, we may still store it in caches "
"or backups, but these backups will eventually be purged.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We may store IP addresses and other information for longer periods "
"of time if we deem it necessary to protect our site.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h2>\n"
"        Security\n"
"    </h2>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        No service is completely secure, but we work hard to protect the "
"information about you from unauthorized access or use.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h2>\n"
"        Choices\n"
"    </h2>\n"
"\n"
"    If you do not want us using your information, the best solution is to "
"refrain from providing it to us. Most notably, if you do not wish to give us "
"an email address or online identifier, don't create an account. If you "
"create an account and later regret it, you can request we delete your "
"existing account.\n"
"\n"
"    <h2>\n"
"        GDPR\n"
"    </h2>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the "
"GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your "

"    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>\n"
"    <p>These rules are preliminary; we will adjust them based on feedback "
"from the community. If we do, we might have to recategorize some replays.</"
"p>\n"
"    <h2>Overview</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        There are three types of replays on Silent Selene: regular, TAS, and "
"unlisted. Most replays are <b>regular</b>; that describes runs that are "
"played normally, without any unusual tools to assist the player. (Tools that "
"do not change the character of the run are still allowed in regular "
"replays.) <b>TAS</b> replays are tool-assisted; any helper tools are "
"allowed, even ones that are obviously \"cheating\" like save states. But the "
"replay still has to be a replay of the actual game. And <b>unlisted</b> runs "
"are everything else; this category mostly applies to replays that changed "
"the game's patterns somehow or made other crazy changes.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>tl;dr</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        For regular runs, most tools like vpatch are allowed. Translation "
"patches are allowed. Pause buffering is not allowed.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h2>Is My Replay Regular?</h2>\n"
"    <h3>General Rules</h3>\n"
"    <h4>Expert replays</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        A few things are not allowed in <b>expert replays</b>, but are "
"allowed for everyone else. Some things shouldn't be allowed at high levels "
"of competition, but we don't want to restrict novice and intermediate "
"players too much, especially if they're excited to upload replays of their "
"successful runs. An expert replay is any replay which meets any of these "
"criteria:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Lunatic\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Uses no bombs\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Does not miss; that is, does not lose a life\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Has a good score: a score noticeably higher than that of an "
"average 1cc that does not engage with the scoring mechanics\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <h4>What's Allowed</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        These tools (and classes of tools) are OK to use in regular "
"replays.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            The low-latency tool \"vpatch\" is allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Special DLLs to translate DirectX to other graphics APIs are "
"allowed. For example, \"ENB Converter\" and \"dgVoodoo\" are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Emulators, or other tools that run a binary on an operation "
"system or computer for which it was not designed, are allowed. This includes "
"PC-98 emulators such as \"Neko Project II\", as well as programs like "
"\"Wine\" that allow players to run Windows games on other operating "
"systems.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Patches which translate the game's text are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Patches which modify the way the game's score is displayed so as "
"to avoid a \"counterstop\" are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <h4>What's Banned</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The following things are explicitly not allowed in regular replays.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Any patch that modifies the game's behavior is not allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Loading save states is not allowed. This includes any "
"\"runahead\" emulator functionality that relies on save states.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Pause buffering, the technique of repeatedly pausing in quick "
"succession to gain an advantage, is not allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Pausing to gain an advantage, such as pausing when bullets are "
"onscreen in order to read them, is not allowed. We may exempt specific "
"replays from this rule if we deem the advantage unintentional.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Editing a replay file after it has been saved is not allowed "
"(except for renaming it).\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <h4>My tool isn't mentioned!</h4>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        If a type of tool isn't listed above, feel free to ask the Silent "
"Selene staff to clarify the situation; we will judge these tools on a case-"
"by-case basis and update the rules accordingly.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <h3>Game-specific rules</h3>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            <b>TH06</b>: Texture patches that affect the appearance of the "
"game, such as the \"hitbox patch\", are not allowed in expert replays.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            <b>TH10</b>: \"Hint files\" are allowed.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            <b>TH11</b>: \"Hint files\" are not allowed.\n"

"    <p>\n"
"        Our Services are provided \"as is.\" Silent Selene hereby disclaim "

"allowed by applicable law, including, without limitation, the warranties of "
"merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. "
"Neither the Silent Selene, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any "
"warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be "
"continuous or uninterrupted. You understand that you download from, or "
"otherwise obtain content or services through, our Services at your own "
"discretion and risk.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Except to the extent any applicable law provides otherwise, the "
"Agreement and any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the "
"laws of the state of New York, U.S.A. Nothing in this Agreement affects your "
"rights as a consumer to rely on mandatory provisions in your country of "
"residence.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        In no event will Silent Selene, or its suppliers, partners, or "
"licensors, be liable (including for any third-party products or services "
"purchased or used through our Services) with respect to any subject matter "
"of the Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other "
"legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential "
"damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; "
"(iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any "
"amounts that exceed $50. Silent Selene shall have no liability for any "
"failure or delay due to matters beyond its reasonable control. The foregoing "
"shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        European Users: If we cause damage to you and you are a consumer in "
"Europe, we limit our liability to the maximum amount permissible in your "
"country of residence. Liability will be limited to foreseeable damages "
"arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this "
"type of contract. Silent Selene isn't liable for damages that result from a "
"non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of "
"liability will not apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, "
"to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, "
"liability caused by our willful misconduct or gross negligence, or our "
"responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you. You and "
"we agree that we and our affiliates' total liability is limited to $50. To "
"the extent that our liability is limited or excluded, the limitations or "
"exclusions will also apply to the personal liability of our legal "
"representatives and vicarious agents.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Indemnification</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Silent Selene, its "
"contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, "
"employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, "
"demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys' fees, "
"arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not "
"limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider "
"of third-party services used in connection with the Services or Content that "
"you post.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Translation</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may "
"translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict "
"between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the "
"English version will control.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply "
"to any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between Silent "
"Selene and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is "
"unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement, "
"and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the "
"Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the "
"Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such "
"term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Silent Selene may assign its rights under the Agreement without "
"condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with our "
"prior written consent.\n"
