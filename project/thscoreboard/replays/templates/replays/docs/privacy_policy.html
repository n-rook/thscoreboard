    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! At Silent Selene, you can upload your Touhou replays, as well as take a look at other replays that interest you. We need to collect and store some information in order to make this happen; here we describe how that happens.
    </p>
    <h2>What this document covers</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy covers silentselene.net, the website.
    </p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
    <p>
        Most of the information we collect is information that is provided to us by you. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Basic account information:</b> We collect certain information, such as a username and password, so that you can have and log into an account. Of course, we store any settings or preferences you set on your account, too, such as language preference or what games you're interested in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Public profile information:</b> Some information, such as your username, is present on your public profile, and is considered public information. Note that your email address is not public information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Content:</b> Silent Selene is primarily a site to share replays. As such, we will store replays and information about them, so that you or other people can check them out later.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
    <p>
        We also collect some information automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Log information:</b> Like most online service provides, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operation system, and mobile network information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Location information:</b> We may use your IP address or other identifiers to guess your location, in order to provide features such as automatic language detection.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are a foundational technology of the Internet. We use cookies to allow users to log in.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How and Why We Use Information</h2>
    <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
    <p>
        We use information about you for the purposes below:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>To provide our Services.</b> For example, to set up and maintain your account, make your replays available, and provide additional fun information about your experiences with Touhou.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>To improve our Services.</b> For example, by seeing how users interact with our Services to see what features are popular.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</b> For example, by detecting security incidents, or detecting malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity on the site. In the past, malicious actors have used Touhou fansites harm other people, such as by publicizing personal information about innocent figures, or impersonating other players to destroy their reputation; we wish to prevent Silent Selene from becoming a venue for these attacks, or from being attacked itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>To fix problems with our Services.</b> For example, by detecting or fixing bugs on our website.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>To communicate with you.</b> For example, to share information about your content with you.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>EU note: What's our legal basis?</h3>
    <p>
        Our processing of personal data is based on two bases. Most of our processing occurs after the user has consented; for example, a person may create an account, and then we use their username and password to let them use the account later. Or, a user may upload Content to be seen by others, and then we show that Content to others. Some information is processed to protect our legitimate interests, such as our interest in not allowing Silent Selene to be used as a venue for attacks on other people; for example, we collect and store IP addresses in order to make it more difficult for a banned user to access the site in the future.
    </p>
    <h2>Sharing Information</h2>
    <h3>How We Share Information</h3>
    <p>
        We share information about you in only limited circumstances.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Third-party services:</b> We use third-party services in order to provide our Services. For example, our website is hosted by another company. We only use third-party services in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Legal and regulatory requirements:</b> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. This seems like a rather unlikely scenario, but it is listed here for completeness. Please do not commit crimes in your Touhou replays. Capturing Sakuya's final spell, "Eternal Meek", by using a safespot is not considered a crime for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, though it may lead to bad karma or punishment in the afterlife.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Public Information</h3>
    <p>
        Public information is, in fact, public. If you choose to make information public, we will disclose it publicly. Visitors on the website may see it, and we may provide it to third-party services such as Discord if other people share links to it there. In addition, we may make the public replays posted on our site available in bulk to other people.
    </p>

    <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>
    <p>
        We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it. For example, if content is deleted, we stop storing it in our database within 30 days after its deletion. After this time period is up, we may still store it in caches or backups, but these backups will eventually be purged.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may store IP addresses and other information for longer periods of time if we deem it necessary to protect our site.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Security
    </h2>

    <p>
        No service is completely secure, but we work hard to protect the information about you from unauthorized access or use.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Choices
    </h2>

    If you do not want us using your information, the best solution is to refrain from providing it to us. Most notably, if you do not wish to give us an email address or online identifier, don't create an account. If you create an account and later regret it, you can request we delete your existing account.

    <h2>
        GDPR
    </h2>

    <p>
        If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Request access to your personal data;
            </li>
            <li>
                Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
            </li>
            <li>
                Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
            </li>
            <li>
                Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
            </li>
            <li>
                Request portability of your personal data.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.
    </p>

        Privacy Policy Changes
    </h2>

    <h2>
        Translation
