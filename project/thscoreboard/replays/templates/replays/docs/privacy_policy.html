    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! At Silent Selene, you can upload your Touhou replays, as well as take a look at other replays that interest you. We need to collect and store some information in order to make this happen; here we describe how that happens.
    </p>
    <h2>What this document covers</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy covers silentselene.net, the website.
    </p>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
    <p>
        Most of the information we collect is information that is provided to us by you. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Basic account information:</b> We collect certain information, such as a username, password and email address, so that you can have and log into an account. Of course, we store any settings or preferences you set on your account, too, such as language preference or what games you're interested in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Public profile information:</b> Some information, such as your username, is present on your public profile, and is considered public information. Note that your email address is not public information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Content:</b> Silent Selene is primarily a site to share replays. As such, we will store replays and information about them, so that you or other people can check them out later.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
    <p>
        We also collect some information automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Log information:</b> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operation system, and mobile network information.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cookies:</b> Cookies are a foundational technology of the Internet. We use cookies to allow users to log in; these cookies are essential to Silent Selene's functionality.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How and Why We Use Information</h2>
    <h3>How We Use Information</h3>
    <p>
        We use information about you for the purposes below:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>To make our site function.</b> For example, to set up and maintain your account, make your replays available, and provide additional fun information about your experiences with Touhou.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>To make our site better.</b> For example, by seeing how users interact with our Services to see what features are popular.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>To protect Silent Selene, our users, and the public.</b> For example, by detecting security incidents, or detecting malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity on the site. In the past, malicious actors have used Touhou fansites harm other people, such as by publicizing personal information about innocent figures, or impersonating other players to destroy their reputation; we wish to prevent Silent Selene from becoming a venue for these attacks, or from being attacked itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>To fix problems with Silent Selene.</b> For example, by detecting or fixing bugs on our website.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>To communicate with you.</b> For example, to share information about your content with you.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>EU note: What's our legal basis?</h3>
    <p>
        Our processing of personal data is based on two bases. Most of our processing occurs after the user has consented; for example, a person may create an account, and then we use their username, password and email address to let them use the account later. Or, a user may upload content to be seen by others, and then we show that content to others. Some information is processed to protect our legitimate interests, such as our interest in not allowing Silent Selene to be used as a venue for attacks on other people; for example, we collect and store IP addresses in order to make it more difficult for a banned user to access the site in the future.
    </p>
    <h2>Sharing Information</h2>
    <h3>How We Share Information</h3>
    <p>
        We share information about you in only limited circumstances.
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Third-party services:</b> We use third-party services in order to provide our Services. For example, the server for our website is provided by Vultr, and e-mails are sent out using the Amazon Simple Email Service. We only use third-party services in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Legal and regulatory requirements:</b> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request. This seems like a rather unlikely scenario, but it is listed here for completeness. Please do not commit crimes in your Touhou replays. Capturing Sakuya's final spell, "Eternal Meek", by using a safespot is not considered a crime for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, though it may lead to bad karma or punishment in the afterlife.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Public Information</h3>
    <p>
        Public information is, in fact, public. If you choose to make information public, we will disclose it publicly. Visitors on the website may see it, and we may provide it to third-party services such as Discord if other people share links to it there. In addition, we may make the public replays posted on our site available in bulk to other people.
    </p>

    <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>
    <p>
        We only keep information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which we collect and use it. For some information, this means we keep it indefinitely unless you request it be removed; for example, if you upload a replay, we will keep it until you delete it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a user has requested that information be deleted, we may retain that information for a short period of time, in order to preserve backups, investigate problems with the site, let the user change their mind, or other necessary purposes. However, in almost all cases, we will not preserve such information for over 120 days. All exceptions to this 120-day rule are explicitly listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
        We record the IP addresses of visitors to the site. If the visitor is logged in with their account, we associate it with the account in question. This is necessary to protect the website from people who would misuse it. As above, these IP addresses are not stored for over 120 days.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may ban IP addresses from accessing the site, if necessary to protect it. In this case, we will continue to store the IP address in question, as well as why it was banned. This information will not be kept for over 15 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an account is suspended, we will keep its username, email address, and the reason for the suspension in our records for the duration of the suspension, even if the user in question requests their account be deleted. This is necessary to prevent them from evading their ban, and thus to protect the site as a whole. This information will not be kept for longer than 120 days after either the suspension expires or after the account's deletion is requested, whichever is later. Suspensions will always expire at most 15 years after they are instituted.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Security
    </h2>

    <p>
        No service is completely secure, but we work hard to protect the information about you from unauthorized access or use.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Choices
    </h2>

    If you do not want us using your information, the best solution is to refrain from providing it to us. Most notably, if you don't wish to give us an email address or online identifier, don't create an account. If you create an account and later regret it, you can request we delete your existing account.

    <h2>
        GDPR
    </h2>

    <p>
        If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Request access to your personal data;
            </li>
            <li>
                Request correction or deletion of your personal data;
            </li>
            <li>
                Object to our use and processing of your personal data;
            </li>
            <li>
                Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data; and
            </li>
            <li>
                Request portability of your personal data.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Translation
    </h2>
