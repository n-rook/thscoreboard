    <h2>General Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not use the site if you are under 13 (or 16 in Europe).</li>
        <li>Do not impersonate other members of the Touhou community, or upload replays that are not yours.</li>
        <li>Do not create multiple accounts.</li>
        <li>Do not try to pass off tool-assisted replays as having been played without the use of restricted tools. (For more information on which tools are allowed, see the <a href="{{ replay_rules_url }}">Replay Rules</a>.)</li>
        <li>Do not encourage illegal activity or provide information about piracy. (Note that using an emulator is not illegal.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The rules above are not exhaustive; we may enforce bans or other punishment at our own discretion for any behavior we judge harmful to the Touhou community.
    </p>
