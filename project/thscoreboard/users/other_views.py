    The account registration flow works as follows:

    1. The user visits /register and sees a registration form, asking for a
       username, password and email address.
    2. If the user's selected username and email are not used by actual users,
       we add them to the "unverified_users" table, then send them an email.
       unverified_users are NOT real users; they do not block other users from
       registering with the given username or email address, and there are no
       unique columns on unverified_users. This means that username is not a
       primary key of this table.
    3. We send an email to the email address in question with a link to an
       "email verification" page, containing the primary key for their
       unverified_users user.
    4. If the user clicks that page, they see a confirmation page because
       I don't want to confirm somebody's account with a GET.
    5. If they POST there, they get a real account.
    6. TODO: We set up a cleanup cron job to delete temporary users so that we
       are not indefinitely holding these rows.

    TODO: If a user tries to log in as an unverified user, we should resend
    the notification email, even though they cannot log in yet.
